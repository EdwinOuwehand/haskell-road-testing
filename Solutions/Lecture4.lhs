Recall from last time: 

> update :: Eq a => (a -> b) -> (a,b) -> a -> b
> update f (x,y) = \ z -> if x == z then y else f z 

> updates :: Eq a => (a -> b) -> [(a,b)] -> a -> b
> updates = foldl update

==

> infixl 1 $$
> 
> ($$) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
> ($$) = flip ($)
 

==

We can use this to implement *variable assignment*,
the basic action in imperative programming.

Define a *variable environment* (the representation of the
computer memory) as a function from variables to appropriate
values, let us say integers. 

> type Var = String
> type Env = Var -> Integer

==

To implement variable assignment we need a datatype for expressions, for 
the assign command assigns an expression to a variable. 

> data Expr = I Integer | V Var 
>           | Add Expr Expr 
>           | Subtr Expr Expr 
>           | Mult Expr Expr 
>           deriving (Eq,Show)

==

**Evaluation of an expression in an environment**

> eval :: Expr -> Env -> Integer 
> eval (I i) _ = i 
> eval (V name) env = env name
> eval (Add e1 e2) env = (eval e1 env) + (eval e2 env)
> eval (Subtr e1 e2) env = (eval e1 env) - (eval e2 env)
> eval (Mult e1 e2) env = (eval e1 env) * (eval e2 env)

==

**Variable Assignment in an Environment**

> assign :: Var -> Expr -> Env -> Env 
> assign var expr env =  update env (var, eval expr env)

==

**Environment initialisation**

An environment is a finite object, so it will yield 
$\bot$ (undefined) for all but a finite number of variables. 

The initial environment is everywhere undefined: 

> initEnv :: Env 
> initEnv = \ _ -> undefined
 
Another way of saying this:

    initEnv = const undefined

==

**The Four Ingredients of Imperative Programming**

1. Variable Assignment: `<var> := <expr>`

2. Conditional Execution: 
   `if <bexpr> then <statement1> else <statement2>`

3. Sequential Composition: `<statement1> ; <statement2>`

4. Iteration: `while <expr> do <statement>`

==

These four ingredients make for a [Turing
complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
programming language.  A programming language is *Turing complete* if
it is powerful enough to simulate a single taped [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

It is believed that such languages can express any function 
that can be computed by an algorithm. This article of faith 
is called the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis).

**Review Question** Why is it impossible to *prove* the Church-Turing Thesis?

==

**Implementation of While Language in Haskell**

Conditions: 

> data Condition = Prp Var 
>                | Eq Expr Expr 
>                | Lt Expr Expr 
>                | Gt Expr Expr 
>                | Ng Condition 
>                | Cj [Condition] 
>                | Dj [Condition]
>                deriving (Eq,Show)

**Note** This is a special case of *Propositional Logic*. 

==

Statements: 

> data Statement = Ass Var Expr
>                | Cond Condition Statement Statement
>                | Seq [Statement]
>                | While Condition Statement
>                deriving (Eq,Show)

==

**Condition Evaluation**

> evalc :: Condition -> Env -> Bool
> evalc (Eq e1 e2) env = eval e1 env == eval e2 env
> evalc (Lt e1 e2) env = eval e1 env <  eval e2 env
> evalc (Gt e1 e2) env = eval e1 env >  eval e2 env 
> evalc (Ng c) env = not (evalc c env)
> evalc (Cj cs) env = and (map (\ c -> evalc c env) cs)
> evalc (Dj cs) env = or  (map (\ c -> evalc c env) cs)

==

**Statement Execution**

Executing a statement of the While language should be 
an operation that maps environments to environments. 

> exec :: Statement -> Env -> Env 
> exec (Ass v e) env = assign v e env
> exec (Cond c s1 s2) env = 
>  if evalc c env then exec s1 env else exec s2 env 
> exec (Seq ss) env = foldl (flip exec) env ss 
> exec w@(While c s) env = 
>  if not (evalc c env) then env 
>  else exec w (exec s env) 

==

**Example**

Imperative program for computing the Fibonacci numbers:         

    fib n
    x := 0; y := 1; 
    while n > 0 do { z := x; x := y; y := z+y; n := n-1 }


> fib :: Statement
> fib = Seq [Ass "x" (I 0), Ass "y" (I 1), 
>            While (Gt (V "n") (I 0))
>              (Seq [Ass "z" (V "x"), 
>                    Ass "x" (V "y"),
>                    Ass "y" (Add (V "z") (V "y")), 
>                    Ass "n" (Subtr (V "n") (I 1))])]

==

To *run* such programs, we initialize some variables
to create an *environment*, execute a *statement*, and
finally inspect, in the result environment, a list of variables that we are
interested in. 
   
        
> run :: [(Var,Integer)] -> Statement -> [Var] -> [Integer]
> run xs program vars = 
>   exec program (updates initEnv xs) $$ 
>     \ env -> map (\c -> eval c env) (map V vars)

Now we can run `fib`:

> runFib n = run [("n",n)] fib ["x"]
 
==

**Comparison with Functional Version**

Here is the definition of `while` again: 

> while :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
> while = until . (not.)

==

**While + Return**

Sometimes it is useful to include a function for 
transforming the result: 

> whiler :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> (a -> b) -> a -> b
> whiler p f r = r . while p f 

==

Now we can do *fib* in *functional imperative style*: 

> fibonacci :: Integer -> Integer
> fibonacci n = fibon (0,1,n) where 
>   fibon = whiler 
>            (\ (_,_,n) -> n > 0)
>            (\ (x,y,n) -> (y,x+y,n-1))
>            (\ (x,_,_) -> x)

==

The key to showing the correctness of the imperative version of 
the Fibonacci algorithm is to show that `(x,y) = (F(N-n),F(N-n+1))` holds
for the step inside the `while` loop, where N is the initial value
of variable `n`. 

In other words, suppose `(x,y) = (F(N-n),F(N-n+1))`, and execute the
statement `(x,y,n) := (y,x+y,n-1)`.

Then afterwards, `(x,y) = (F(N-n),F(N-n+1))` holds again.

==

The functional programmer, instead of checking a loop invariant, 
proves with induction on `k` that after the call `fb n`, 
`fb'` is always called with parameters `F(n-k), F(n-k+1), k`. 

We see that proving the *loop invariant* corresponds to proving the
*inductive step in the induction proof*.

In the imperative version we have to deal with three variables `x,y,n`
and in the recursive functional version we reason about three function
arguments.

==

**While Loops as Fixpoints**

The definition of a fixpoint operation. 

> fp :: Eq a => (a -> a) -> a -> a 
> fp f = until (\ x -> x == f x) f

Using this, we can construct another variation on Fibonacci: 

> fbo n = (0,1,n) $$ 
>          fp (\ (x,y,k) -> if k == 0 then (x,y,k) else (y,x+y,k-1))

==

**YBC7289: Approximating $\sqrt{2}$**

![](../images/YBC7289.jpg)

==

[The Babylonian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) of computing square roots: repeatedly take the
average of an overestimation $x$ and an underestimation $a/x$ to
$\sqrt{a}$.

. . .

If $\sqrt{a} < x$ then $a/\sqrt{a} > a/x$, i.e., $a/x < \sqrt{a}$.

. . .

Conversely, if  $\sqrt{a} > x$ then $a/\sqrt{a} < a/x$, i.e., $a/x > \sqrt{a}$.

. . .

Next, take the average of $x$ and $a/x$.

That is, consider the function $\lambda x \mapsto \frac{x +a/x}{2}$.

==

Let $y$ be a fixpoint of $\lambda x \mapsto \frac{x +a/x}{2}$. 

Then

$y = \frac{y +a/y}{2}$

$2y = y +a/y$

$y = a/y$

$y^2 = a$

$y = \sqrt{a}$




==

This works well in Haskell because of the 
limited precision of floating point numbers. 

> bab a = \ x -> ((x + a/x)/2)
>
> sr a = fp (bab a) a

This gives:

     *FSA3> sr 2
     1.414213562373095
     *FSA3> sr 3
     1.7320508075688772
     *FSA3> sr 4
     2.0
     *FSA3> sr 5
     2.23606797749979

==

**Review question** How can you *test* this square root program?             

. . .

To see a bit clearer what goes on here, use the following function:

> iterateFix :: Eq a => (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
> iterateFix f = apprx . iterate f where
>   apprx (x:y:zs) = if x == y then [x] else x: apprx (y:zs)
     
     *Lecture4> iterateFix (bab 2) 1
     [1.0,1.5,1.4166666666666665,1.4142156862745097,1.4142135623746899,1.414213562373095]
     *Lecture4> iterateFix (bab 3) 1
     [1.0,2.0,1.75,1.7321428571428572,1.7320508100147274,1.7320508075688772]
     *Lecture4> iterateFix (bab 4) 1
     [1.0,2.5,2.05,2.000609756097561,2.0000000929222947,2.000000000000002,2.0]

==

**Fix**

Haskell has a special fixpoint operator that can be used to implement
recursion.         

> fix :: (a -> a) -> a
> fix f = f (fix f)

Alternative definition:

    fix f = let x = f x in x

> fbx n = (0,1,n) $$ 
>          fix (\ f (x,y,k) -> if k == 0 then x else f (y,x+y,k-1))

Without using `fix`:

> fbb n = fbbb (0,1,n) where 
>   fbbb (x,y,n) = if n == 0 then x else fbbb (y,x+y,n-1)

Or in curried notation:   

> fbc n = fbbc 0 1 n where 
>   fbbc x y n = if n == 0 then x else fbbc y (x+y) (n-1)
    
==

**Fix** can be used to implement recursion without using other functions
that call themselves.

To see why this works, notice that `fbx` will compute a fixed point of
   the function

      k = (\ f (x,y,k) ->
            if k == 0 then (x,y,k) else f (y,x+y,k-1))

that is, a function `h` such that `h = k  h`:

      h = k h =
         (\ f (x,y,k) ->
            if k == 0 then (x,y,k) else f (y,x+y,k-1)) h
        = \ (x,y,k) ->
            if k == 0 then (x,y,k) else h (y,x+y,k-1))

This is indeed the recursive Fibonacci function.

==

**Review question**

Explain the connection between `fp` and `fix`.

. . .
        
To see a connection between `fp` and `fix`, 
consider the following definition of `fp` in terms of `fix`: 

> fp' :: Eq a => (a -> a) -> a -> a
> fp' f = fix (\ g x -> if x == f x then x else g (f x))
 
 
==

And here are definitions of `until` and `while` in terms of `fix`: 

> until' :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
> until' p f = fix 
>               (\ g x -> if p x then x else g (f x))
  

> while' :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
> while' p f = fix 
>               (\ g x -> if not (p x) then x else g (f x))
        
==

**Let's Talk about QuickCheck**


[QuickCheck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) is a very
influential random test generation approach to testing.

      "In QuickCheck the programmer writes assertions about logical
     properties that a function should fulfill. Then QuickCheck attempts to
     generate test cases that falsify these assertions. The project was
     started in 1999. Besides being used to test regular programs,
     QuickCheck is also useful for building up a functional specification,
     for documenting what functions should be doing, and for testing
     compiler implementations."
     
The latest version of the code can be found at
[github](https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck).
There is a (slightly outdated) [QuickCheck Manual](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html). The original paper on QuickCheck is
[@ClaessenHughes2000:q]. This is recommended reading.

**QuickCheck Example: The Pebble Game**

> data Color = W | B deriving (Eq,Show)
>
> drawPebble :: [Color] -> [Color]
> drawPebble [] = []
> drawPebble [x] = [x]
> drawPebble (W:W:xs) = drawPebble (B:xs) 
> drawPebble (B:B:xs) = drawPebble (B:xs) 
> drawPebble (W:B:xs) = drawPebble (W:xs) 
> drawPebble (B:W:xs) = drawPebble (W:xs) 

**What is the colour of the last pebble?**

==

**Test Generators**


     newtype Gen a = MkGen{ unGen :: StdGen -> Int -> a }
     
     instance Functor Gen where
       fmap f (MkGen h) =
         MkGen (\r n -> f (h r n))
     
     instance Monad Gen where
       return x =
         MkGen (\_ _ -> x)
       
       MkGen m >>= k =
         MkGen (\r n ->
           let (r1,r2)  = split r
               MkGen m' = k (m r1 n)
            in m' r2 n
         )

==

**RandomGen, next**

The class `RandomGen`, defined in `System.Random`, provides a common
interface to random number generators.

Minimal complete definition: `next` and `split`.

     next :: g -> (Int, g)

The `next` operation returns an `Int` that is uniformly distributed in the
range returned by `genRange` (including both end points), and a new
generator.

==

**split**


     split :: g -> (g, g)


The `split` operation allows one to obtain two distinct random number
generators. This is very useful in functional programs (for example,
when passing a random number generator down to recursive calls).

==

**StdGen**

Instance of `RandomGen`. 

Defined in `System.Random` module.

==

**choose**

Defined in `QuickCheck` module. 

Generates a random element in the given inclusive range.


     choose :: Random a => (a,a) -> Gen a
     choose rng = MkGen (\r _ -> 
                  let (x,_) = randomR rng r in x)

==

**Random a**

Defined in `QuickCheck` module. 

With a source of random number supply in hand, the `Random` class allows
the programmer to extract random values of a variety of types.

Minimal complete definition: `randomR` and `random`.

     randomR :: RandomGen g => (a, a) -> g -> (a, g)

Takes a range `(lo,hi)` and a random number generator `g`, and returns a
random value uniformly distributed in the closed interval `[lo,hi]`,
together with a new generator. It is unspecified what happens if
`lo>hi`.

==

     random :: RandomGen g => g -> (a, g)

The same as `randomR`, but using a default range determined by the type:

   - For bounded types (instances of Bounded, such as Char), the range is
     normally the whole type.

   - For fractional types, the range is normally
     the semi-closed interval `[0,1)`.

   - For Integer, the range is (arbitrarily) the range of `Int`.

==

**Class Arbitrary**

Defined in `QuickCheck` module. 

Random generation and shrinking of values.

     class Arbitrary a where
       -- | A generator for values of the given type.
       arbitrary :: Gen a
       arbitrary = error "no default generator"
       
       -- | Produces a (possibly) empty list of 
       -- all the possible
       -- immediate shrinks of the given value.
       shrink :: a -> [a]
       shrink _ = []

==
     
**Making Color an Instance of Arbitrary**


> instance Arbitrary Color where
>   arbitrary = oneof [return W, return B]

This allows QuickCheck to derive  `Arbitrary [Color]` ... 

Here is how: 

     instance Arbitrary a => Arbitrary [a] where
       arbitrary = sized $ \n ->
         do k <- choose (0,n)
            sequence [ arbitrary | _ <- [1..k] ]
     
       shrink xs = removeChunks xs ...

==

**sample for generating example values**

     sample' :: Gen a -> IO [a]
     sample' (MkGen m) =
       do rnd0 <- newStdGen
          let rnds rnd = rnd1 : rnds rnd2 
                         where (rnd1,rnd2) = split rnd
          return [(m r n) | 
                  (r,n) <- rnds rnd0 `zip` [0,2..20] ]

==
     
Generating some example values and print them to `stdout`: 
     

     sample :: Show a => Gen a -> IO ()
     sample g =
       do cases <- sample' g
          sequence_ (map print cases)

==

**Example Use**

     *Lecture4> sample $ (arbitrary :: Gen [Color])
     []
     [W]
     [W,W]
     [W,B,W]
     [W,B,W,B]
     [B,B,B,W,B,W,W]
     [B,W,B,W,B,W,B,W,B,B,W]
     []
     [B,B,B,B,B,W,B,B,W,B,W,W,W,B]
     [W,W,B,B,W,W,B,W,B,B,B,B,W,W,B]
     [W,W,W,W,W,W,B,B,B,W,B,W,B,B]

==

**Stating an Invariant**
     
> numberW :: [Color] -> Int
> numberW = length . (filter (== W)) 
>     
> parityW :: [Color] -> Int
> parityW xs =  mod (numberW xs) 2
>     
> prop_invariant xs = 
>   parityW xs == parityW (drawPebble xs)

==
